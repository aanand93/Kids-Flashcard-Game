# Kids-Flashcard-Game

## Project Description

My project is a flash card memory game for kids. The object of the game is to flip each card and match it with another card on the board. Every card that you get wrong will flip back over until you get it right.

## User Stories

As a user I want to be able to see all the cards on the screen and flip 2 at a time over to see if I am matching them. If I get it wrong the cards should flip back over so I can guess again. When I get a two cards right, I want the cards to stay flipped up so I can see which cards I still have left. Once I guess them all right I should win the game.

## MVP Goals

- Create a board that has 20 cards on it with data on one side and a logo on the top.
- Have the cards be able to flip over when clicked
- Allow only 2 cards to be flipped at a time
- If data doesn't match on the 2 cards, have them flip back
- If the data matches on both cards, have them stay flipped
- Once all the cards are correctly matched, display "Winner"

## Stretch Goals

- Add pictures instead of data to each card
- Track scores over time even if the page reloads
- Add styling to show the user that each card is clicked when you actually click it (use transform and transition in css)
- Let the user insert their own images so that that is the data they are matching
